				<h3>Welcome to the TRAA</h3>
				<p>The TRAA is not a fishing club, although most members are anglers and share 
fishing as a common interest.
We are a "hands on" environmental group who likes to work at a grass roots level.</p>

<p>The TRAA is a volunteer organization, governed by a formal constitution and by-laws</p>
<p>An elected Executive, with the guidence of the General Membership, sets the policies and direction for the TRAA.
</p>
<p>by those who just want to be part of the solution. 
Either way, every member of the TRAA is active in their advocacy for the health of the Thames River watershed and its inhbitants.</p>
<p>Thames River watershed, particularly the dwindling smallmouth bass population in the North Thames River.</p>
<h3>Fundrasing</h3>
<p>Donations help the TRAA with our most vital projects</p>
<p>These include: TRAA Trout Hatchery, Salmonid Monitoring 
and the Komoka Creek Hydrological Study
If you would love to take an active role in raising funds please email us!</p>
